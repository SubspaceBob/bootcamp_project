We want to build a SW giving a simulated driver the possiblity to
start/stop a vehicle, change it gears and accelelrate/decelerate it.

This will be done using two threads, the first one running a CAN reader
taking the input from driver and placing it in a shared memory.
The second one a component processing the input from driver and 
outputting the vehicle status on CAN in order to emulate engine and
gearbox of a car.

For inputs/outputs see CanFrameMessages.txt
